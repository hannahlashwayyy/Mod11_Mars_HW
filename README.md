#Recieved assistance via tutoring for Step 3 and Step 4 in Part 2. For step 3, I needed help writing my for loop, I was struggling with what functions and specific syntax to use. For Step 4, we reviewed how to cast datatypes with one example and then I typed out everything else with the tutor watching. Steps 5 I did on my own, I briefly used Chat GPT to refresh myself with the syntax for setting size and how to bold for fonts but for the rest of my graph work I referenced previous assignments.
